# Virtual-Pet-App
Lab 2 for CSE 438: Mobile App Development

Users have the option between 5 different pets to interact with, either by playing with them or feeding their pet. The pet may only be played with if its food level is above 0. Sounds are played whenever the user feeds or plays with their pet. Taught myself how to add audio in Swift.
